# Stellar Health Take-Home Challenge

*Note: the current code is not fully functional*

** To Run: **

Navigate to directory through command line > run 'ruby runner.rb'

** Approach: **

I attempted to divide the code into separate files for the logic, setting up the environment, and the actual script runner. This could allow for easier scalability and adaptation depending on the long term needs of the project.

** Challenges: **

This was my first time working with AWS S3 in this context, so a large chunk of my time was spent reading documentation and setting up my environment to contact the server. Due to that, the code is not complete in it's functionality (it's currently not connecting properly). However, I feel with some small adjustments it could run and scale pretty easily.
